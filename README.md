# generalized_linear_models
This repository contains projects that demonstrate my generalized linear modeling skills. Each folder contains the data, R code, LaTex file to generate the report, and the final pdf report. The projects in each folder are described below.

**beta_regression_model**

This project employs a beta regression model to analyze political science data, and includes a simulation study to test the accuracy of the regression estimates. The beta model is compared to linear and logistic regression results to demonstrate the specific advantages of the beta regression approach. This project was completed for a graduate-level statistical computing class.

**logistic_distribution**

This project evaluates the logistic distribution, its parameters, and estimates of its parameters. Three different methods are employed to derive estimates of the parameters for the logistic distribution in both an analysis of real data and a simulation study. This project was completed for a graduate-level statistical computing class.

**logistic_regression_1**

*I was selected as a BYU Student Research Conference Session Winner for this project.*

This project employs randomization inference, two-stage regression, and logistic regression to analyze data from a fully randomized experiment in Tanzania, India, and Peru. The purpose was to identify how the gender characteristics of a messenger can affect policy makersâ€™ acceptance of policy information. Randomization inference is used for difference-of-means testing and logistic regression analysis is used to analyze the experimental results. This project was completed as part of a summer research project.

**logistic_regression_2**

This project uses logistic regression to test how germination differs across different tulip populations in Netherlands, and how the length of the winter impacts the tulips. 10-fold cross validation is employed to find the optimal number of knots for overall model accuracy and the optimal cutoff value is detected to increase the accuracy of predictions. This project was completed for a graduate-level statistical learning class.
